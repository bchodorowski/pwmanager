# pwmanager
A simple password manager.

## Warning
`pwmanager` saves passwords in a json file without any encryption. It is presumed that the json file being used is stored in a secured, encrypted filesystem.

## Prerequisites
This program requires https://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/ to be installed in `$PATH` to work.
